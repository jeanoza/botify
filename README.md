# Botify Coding Test

This application bring the data from Nasa's API and make show that data in a chart thanks for Google Charts.
I will use Axios for fetch data and bootstrap for dropdown button.

github page: https://jeanoza.github.io/botify

## Step 1

- [x] Create a React Application
- [x] Fetch data from NASA's API
- [x] Display That data in a chart using Google Charts

## Step 2

- [x] Implement a user input used to filter the data in your chart

## Step 3

- [x] Implement a Table view of the data with a view switcher

### To improve

- [ ] If i know more about pagination of Nasa API, i would make it more similarly. But, i did my best at the time allocated.
- [ ] If i divided page with router(main, earth, juptr...), it will be more nice, i think.
